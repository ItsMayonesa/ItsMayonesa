## Hi there, I'm ItsMayonesa! üëã
I'm a young student who likes to code useful, testing, non-sense & weird stuff.

---
### üì∑ What I'm currently working on:

My site, I wanted to always make a personal site, as I'm tired of free website makers.

###### Psst! Wanna see how my old site looked? [It's here](https://hxd114649.wixsite.com/mayonesa). I warn you tho, it's in Spanish and it's awful, ugh.
---
### üå± What I'm learning:

I'm learning C. I know it's old, but I'm learning it to use with Arduino boards.

---
### üïë What I'm planning to do in the future:
I'm planning to do many things with C#, including but not only:
- [ ] A set of games including TicTacToe, Rock Paper Scissors etc.
- [ ] A color picker & REST API
- [ ] A HTTP request GUI client
- [ ] Some programs for fake message boxes
- [ ] Some Discord utilities
- [ ] A key-combo program that opens up a tiny window to do different things & extendible with plugins (spoiler: possible name is QuickCmd)

- [ ] And hopefully to turn some programs to Discord bots!

### üì∫ My YouTube career:

I been doing YouTube at the way in 2017, but my content has now focused on fun or interesting PowerPoints, and Garry's Mod! [Check it out! (in Spanish only)](https://www.youtube.com/@ItsMayonesa668/videos)

### üí¨ FAQs:
Good ol' FAQs, here I go:
### Who are you, again?
- I'm ItsMayonesa, a young student who likes to code.

### Age?
- Not telling, but less than 18.

### Gender?
- Male.

### Favorite hobbies?
- Coding, making YouTube videos, playing Garry's Mod, and chatting with friends on Discord.

### Favorite programming language?
- C#

### For your site, why don't you use a free website service like WordPress or Weebly?
- Most website services either make me pay up for a single site, or they leave watermarks like "Made with \[ X ]". Besides, the link will have their name embedded in it.

### Will your programs run on \[ X ] operating system?
- No, my programs are Windows-only based programs. This is because the C# environment only has support for Windows-based libraries for GUIs (WinForms, WPF). There are tools to run WinForms C# code in other OSes, but I don't guarantee the output design of my programs in those OSes nor the used tool.

### Do you have any contact form/information?
- I currently don't have any official contact email or account. If you want to contact me about something, use the Issues tab.

### YouTube channel?
- Yes! I do have a YouTube channel! The link is above here.

### Can I add you on Discord?
- I **do not** accept random friend requests, only from people I know irl, sorry.
